# Hell_Oh_World ~ Read this :)

There are two folders in this Repo. 

1st: "Brackeys Complete Code" folder:

It contains all the files from his site that correspond to the Lessons in the tutorial

=================================================================
=================================================================

2nd: "Our Project" folder:

It contains the project up to episode 4 (Camera follows player).

How to use it: 
1) Download/Clone the Folder. 
2) Open Unity Hub
3) On the Projects tab select "ADD"
4) Select the whole folder as the project
5) Set "Unity Version" parameter to "2019.3.3f1"
6) Then open it as normal.

The program works. Everything are centered and there are directories for each element created. 
I made them manualy to keep it tidy. If you want, play along :D 

P.S.: The camera might seem weirdly placed, but when you play, it snaps to a comfortable position. 
The program WORKS :D
